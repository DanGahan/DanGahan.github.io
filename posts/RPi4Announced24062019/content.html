<p><intro> The now annual annoucement of new Raspberry Pi models took place today with the Raspberry Pi 4 looking like a game changer. With options up to 4GB RAM, full 1GbE and 4k 60fps out this is the first model that is really capable of replacing your desktop PC. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/06/the-raspberry-pi-4-launch-site-runs-on-a-pi-4-cluster/">Ars Technica</a> have a decent break down of new models and benchmarks. </intro></p>
<p>
I think I’ll invest in a few of these for a home cluster. My current thinking is I’ll run <a href="https://k3s.io">K3S</a>, across them and migrate my services on older RPi models onto the cluster. At the moment I have one of the original RPi 1 Model Bs and a RPi 2 model B running a variety of services across the house:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>DHCP service</li>
<li>DNS service</li>
<li>VPN end point</li>
<li>Home baked network monitoring</li>
<li>Various test containers</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I’m also on the hunt for something cheap to run Minecraft on for my 8 year old step-daughter, again the 4GB RAM model should be more than powerful enough.
