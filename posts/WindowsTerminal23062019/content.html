For years we’ve had to endure the cmd.exe command prompt and the equally bad, in my opinion, Powershell terminals. Now, the new and improved Microsoft, who are focused on developer needs in a way Apple could learn a lesson or two from, have unveiled their new native terminal and it looks pretty great a first glance. Coupled with a Windows integrated OpenSSH client a developer can access their remote servers / containers right out the box.

Of course we’ve always had PuTTY, Mobaxterm and a few other notable third party options but a first party offering is a much-welcomed feature and one I’m sure I’ll get a lot of use from whenever forced onto a Windows machine.
