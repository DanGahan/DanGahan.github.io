<intro> As I was driving today I was considering all the ways I keep up to date with the latest news and events in the tech world and my other interests and it struck me, despite being heavily invested in RSS feeds since the Google Reader days (RIP!) and now using Feedly, I’ve becoming increasingly reliant on podcasts to gain more in depth understandings. </intro>

I find it’s a balancing act between having too much content to consume in a week and not enough. I predominantly listen to podcasts when travelling. I have a 30 minute each way commute by car if I travel into my base office and usually find myself travelling to Reading or London once a week which can take around 3 hours each way from South Wales, depending on the mode of transport and the luck of the gods. I also try and listen when sat at my desk but find myself constantly stopping and starting the audio when I’m talking to a colleague or trying to concentrate so usually find playing music, via Spotify, is a better approach in this scenario.

Overcast is my preferred player and has been since it launched when I migrated over from Apple Podcasts. At present all my listening takes place via my iPhone although if / when an Overcast for macOS is released I’m sure it’d be an even split between the two platforms.

Below are a list of podcasts I currently subscribe to and a few thoughts on each. I’ve attempted to categorise them but, as you’ll see, the vast majority fall into the technology category.
</p>
<h5 id="accidental-tech-podcast">Accidental Tech Podcast</h5>
<p>Weekly insights on all things Apple related from Marco Arment, Casey Liss and John Siracusa. Episodes usually come in at around the 2 hour mark so it gives the host plenty of scope to deep dive into a topic. I especially enjoy any topics which can get Siracusa animated as he’s a real geek’s geek.</p>
<h5 id="the-talk-show-with-john-gruber">The Talk Show with John Gruber</h5>
<p>Very similar theme to ATP. In depth Apple based discussions hosted by John Gruber, of <a href="https://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> fame and the creator of Markdown. Gruber is joined by a guest each week, usually from a small circle of Apple commentators. At times Gruber can come across as an Apple apologist but on the whole I agree with his viewpoints.</p>
<h5 id="the-vergecast">The Vergecast</h5>
<p>I’ve been listening to Nilay Patel and the gang’s weekly podcast since their days at Engadget. The Vergecast offers a mix of gadget reviews, tech policy and general tech discussion in an entertaining and often lighthearted format while still managed to dig down into the detail.</p>
<h5 id="software-engineering-daily">Software Engineering Daily</h5>
<p>A daily podcast, running for ~1 hour per episode where host Jeffrey Meyerson interviews a member of the tech community to have an indepth discussion on a chosen topic. The guest comes from a mix of start ups and the big players so you get a great view of how software development is carried out at all levels.</p>
<h5 id="risky-business">Risky Business</h5>
<p>I got turned onto this by someone we recently had in to deliver a training course. The focus of the show is a weekly update on the week’s InfoSec events. I’ve been listening for the past 6 weeks or so and love the mix of insightful topics and the humour.</p>
<h4 id="blakeys-bootroom">Blakey’s Bootroom</h4>
<p>Weekly run through of Cardiff City news and events with former player Nathan Blake and the team at WalesOnline. I don’t always agree with what Blakey has to say but on the whole he seems to talk sense.</p>
<h5 id="wtf">WTF</h5>
<p>I’ve become a huge fan of Marc Maron thanks to his laid back and genuine interview style. Marc’s openess to discuss his own past frequently helps guests open up leading to some fanatastic interviews.</p>
<h5 id="freakanomics-radio">Freakanomics Radio</h5>
<p>Hugely hugely interesting podcast bringing economical topics to the a general audience.</p>
