The <a href="https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/matches/fixtures/">fixtures for the 2019-2020 season</a> were released on Thursday so I thought I’d take the opportunity to have a run through month-by-month and attempt to predict how I think the City will get on. Overall I’d expect us to be there or thereabouts come the end of the season. It’s a tough league so I’d happily settle for a playoff place if offered it now.
