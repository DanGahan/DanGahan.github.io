RIP Peter Whittingham

Tragic news last week about Peter Whittingham’s untimely passing. For me he’s one of the finest players I’ve ever had the pleasure of witnessing wear a City shirt. Blessed with a magical left peg Whittingham would effortlessly saunter round the pitch, as if only half trying, and then out of nowhere produce some piece of match winning brilliance before turning ’round and heading back up the pitch ready for kick off. Whittingham never was one for over dramatic celebrations. A proper footballer.

As I was driving today I was considering all the ways I keep up to date with the latest news and events in the tech world and my other interests and it struck me, despite being heavily invested in RSS feeds since the Google Reader days (RIP!) and now using Feedly, I’ve becoming increasingly reliant on podcasts to gain more in depth understandings.

Retail UX - Todays Encounters
</h3>

I had two encounters whilst out shopping today which made me stop and think about the way stores are embracing technology to alter the in store retail experience. As someone who’s keen to use whatever means possible to get in and out of a shop as quickly as humanly possible I’m a keen supporter of the recent trends we’re seeing of using technology to make life easier in the retail space.

<h3>
Yauch Mixtape

I’m finally getting ’round to finishing the Beastie Boys Book. Anyone familiar with the band would have expected the most poignant chapters to be centered around the passing of MCA, real name Adam Yauch, in 2012. My favourite being a chapter by Mike D titled Yanch Mixtape in which he list songs and albums MCA had become obsessed with over the years. It’s a great list, right up my street, better still user Mateusz Frankowski has created a Spotify playlist which I’m currently blaring into my headphones.<br><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/1175370181/playlist/5l6p3SkZoZF3blby0BZpH9" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
