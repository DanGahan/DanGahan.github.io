###  Retail UX - Todays Encounters
#### DD-MM-YYYY

<intro>
I had two encounters whilst out shopping today which made me stop and think about the way stores are embracing technology to alter the in store retail experience. As someone who's keen to use whatever means possible to get in and out of a shop as quickly as humanly possible I'm a keen supporter of the recent trends we're seeing of using technology to make life easier in the retail space.
</intro>

<p>
<b>A Trip to the Golden Arches</b>
<br>
The first encounter was at a local McDonald's where we'd stopped to grab something <i>quick</i> to eat to try and help me shake off a hangover from hell. I'm not a fan of barking an order at the drive through microphone so I headed inside to order and collect my food.
</p>
<p>
The ordering itself was painless. McDonalds have embraced technology within their restaurants and allow you to order via a self service kiosk. The kiosk is a touch screen device with a well-organised menu. You select whether you're eating in or taking away, select the items you desire and pay via the inbuilt card reader which accepts contactless or a chip and pin payment.
</p>
<p>
So far so good........
</p>
<p>
Once your order is accepted you're given a number on your printed receipt that will be called when your food is ready for collection. You can also track progress of the order via display above the collection point. There are two statuses displayed, preparing or ready for collection.
</p>
<p>
Here's where it all went down hill. I waited a good 15 minutes for my order to be prepared, along with 15 or so other frustrated customers. It took so long my order number actually disappeared from the display so I had no idea what was going on other than my number hadn't been called. When the staff eventually did call my number they had the food laid out on a tray when I'd requested it bagged to take away. I pointed out to the member of staff it'd taken over 15 minutes to prepare two meals and they'd still got it wrong. Rather than apologise and fix the mistake immediately the member of staff came up with an excuse around having just switched from the breakfast to daytime menu. It was only when it was clear to her I wasn't going to take the food on the tray did she put it in a bag which took her another 5 minutes, in which time she disappeared twice.
</p>
<p>
So for all McDonald's fantastic use of technology to make the order process quick and painless they were let down by their processes, if we're to truly believe the delay was caused by the change of menu, and their staff. For those interested, this was the McDonald's off Western Avenue in Cardiff, avoid if at all possible!

<b>Scan as you Shop</b>
<br>
The second encounter with technology whilst out shopping today came at my local Tesco supermarket in Barry. Tesco introduced Scan as you Shop a few years ago and it's cut the amount of time my weekly shop takes me in half. The basic usage of Scan as you Shop is:
<ol>
<li>Scan your clubcard as you enter the store to be assigned a scanner.</li>
<li> As you walk through the store, scan items before putting them in your trolley. As you don't have to pass via a standard checkout you can place the items straight into your bags</li>
<li>Once you completed your shop head towards the assigned area to pay for Scan as you Shop (in my local Tesco it's the same area as the self service checkouts). Scan the barcode on the top of the machine, your shopping will transfer over and pay.
</ol>
I have no complaints whatsoever about the Scan as you Shop experience in Tesco. The handheld scanners have an excellent ergonomic design and are comfortable to hold, the user interface is simple yet effective. You can clearly see what items have been added, their cost and your current grand total. Scanning items works  painlessly the vast majority of the time (I did have some issues scanning blueberries but got there in the end) and you have the option to add any unscanned items when at the checkout. The scanner also uses sounds well to indicate when an item has been scanned.
</p>
As you don't actually need to place your items on the conveyor belt and have them scanned it's entirely possible to complete a shop without ever needing to interact with Tesco's staff. To prevent the system from being exploited and people placing items into their bags without first scanning them Tesco carry out random checks at the checkout area.
</p>
<p>
Random checks take two forms. The usual is for it to instruct the member of staff to scan 10 or so random items in your trolley to ensure they were also previously scanned when placed in. If an item scanned by the staff was not scanned when placed in the trolley it is then added to your bill. There is also a less common check that requires the staff to scan all items in your trolley, this is what I encountered today.
</p>
<p>
From what I'm lead to believe there is a trust based system running on the backend, if all your items match when the staff scan it your reputation will be enhanced. If discrepancies are found your reputation score will decrease. The lower your score the more frequently you'll be selected to have your items checked.
</p>
<p>
Being selected to have all my items scanned really wasn't what I needed with the effects of yesterdays partying still taking their toll but the member of staff who dealt with me couldn't have handled it any better despite having to juggle helping out other customers on the self service machines while trying to assist me. She clearly understood the processes and that it could be frustrating from the customer's perspective having to wait while the items were re-scanned. In this instance Tesco have pretty much nailed the technology, the processes and the people. It takes a lot for me praise a big chain but in this instance I believe it's fully deserved.
</p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br>
So there we are, two different encounters leaving a starkly different impression on me. Hopefully this highlights you can throw all the fancy technology you like at a problem but if your processes and people aren't of the same quality the user experience will not improve.
