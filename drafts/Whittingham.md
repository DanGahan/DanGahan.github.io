###  RIP Peter Whittingham
#### DD-MM-YYYY

<intro>
Tragic news last week about Peter Whittingham's untimely passing. For me he's one of the finest players I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing wear a City shirt. Blessed with a magical left peg Whittingham would effortlessly saunter round the pitch, as if only half trying, and then out of nowhere produce some piece of match winning brilliance before turning 'round and heading back up the pitch ready for kick off. Whittingham never was one for over dramatic celebrations. A proper footballer.
