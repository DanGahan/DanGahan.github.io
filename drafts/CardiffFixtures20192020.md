###  Cardiff City Fixtures 2019-2020
#### DD-MM-YYYY

<intro>
The [fixtures for the 2019-2020 season](https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/matches/fixtures/) were released on Thursday so I thought I'd take the opportunity to have a run through month by month and attempt to predict how I think the City will get on. Overall I'd expect us to be there or thereabouts come the end of the season. It's a tough league so I'd happily settle for a playoff place if offered it now.

**August**

I'd say this is a fairly kind to start away to a Wigan side who finished towards the bottom of last seasons Championship table. Across the month we've 3 away games (Wigan, Reading and Blackburn) all of which we'd fancy ourselves to get something from and 3 home games. The home games look the trickier fixtures, starting off against newly promoted Luton and then facing the two side who were relegated from the Premier League with us, Huddersfield and Fulham.

Prediction: 14 of 18 points (4 win, 2 draws)

**September**

Only 3 games in September, due to international breaks. Derby away will be a tough fixture to start the month. Followed by Middlesbrough at home and Hull away.

Prediction: 4 of 9 points (1 win, 1 draw, 1 loss)

**October**

Things ramp up again in October with 5 fixtures, starting with QPR at home. We then have 2 tough looking fixtures away to West Brom and home to Sheffield Wednesday. The final two fixtures aren't for the faint of heart where we travel to Millwall followed by the South Wales derby away to Swansea.

3 away games in the month will make it tough, especially with one of them being a derby where anything can happen. That said, given the Jacks current problems off the field I'm quietly confident we'll do the double over them this year which would be the first time either team have ever achieved the feat.

Prediction: 8 points from 15 (2 wins, 2 draws, 1 loss)

**November**

November sees 5 games despite the international break half way through the month. City are at home 3 times and way twice during November with the Severnside derby against Bristol City coming just before the international break at the Cardiff City Stadium on November 9th.

In past seasons the wheels have started to fall off when the weather turns but I can't see Warnock allowing that the happen this time around. The away fixtures come against newly promoted Charlton and a fairly poor Forest team so I fancy us to have a good month. I also look forward to us once again teaching Bristol City a footballing lesson!

Prediction: 13 points from 15 (4 wins, 1 draw)

**December**

As tradition dictates, December is a busy month for the City with 6 fixtures including away to Leeds where I'd expect us to pick up 3 points as per usual. Sheffield Wednesday away on the 29th will be a tough fixture but the stand out has to be Millwall home on boxing day. Whoever thought it was a good idea for Cardiff and Millwall to play on a public holiday may regret this one.

Prediction: 13 points from 18 (4 wins, 1 draw, 1 loss)

**January**

The home fixture against the Jacks on January 11th is Januarys stand out fixture. We'd expect to pick something up on the road against QPR and Birmingham and the fixture against WBA at home is also one you'd expect at least a point from.

Prediction: 8 points (2 wins, 2 draws)

**February**

February may be the shortest month in the calendar but the City will be kept busy with 7 scheduled fixtures across the 29 days (its a leap year). 4 home fixtures against Reading, Wigan, Forest and Brentford should give us a solid foundation to work from. If we can pick up a win or two on the road against Luton, Huddersfield and Stoke we'd be flying.

Prediction: 14 points (4 wins, 2 draws, 1 loss)

**March**

4 fixtures in March including City wrapping up their standard 6 points per season against Leeds. Charlton and Preston away should be fixtures we look to get something from as is Charlton home on the 21st.

Prediction: 10 points (3 wins, 1 draw)

**April**

5 fixtures to all but complete the season starting away to Bristol City on the 4th. Fulham away and Derby home look tough fixtures. Middlesbrough away will also be difficult. This may prove to be a difficult run in.

Prediction: 6 points (1 win, 3 draws, 1 loss)

**May**

A single fixture, unless we qualify for the playoffs, rounds the season of in May with City home to Hull.

Prediction: 3 points (1 win)

**Conclusion**

I suspect I'm being overly optimistic here but I predict we'll end up on 93 points. This is enough to finish in the top 2 for the past 10 seasons (and potentially further back) and 3 points more than the total we accrude when promoted in 2017-2018.

Of course, these predictions mean nothing and are hugly biased but it'll be interesting to look back as the season takes place and see just how on or off the mark I was.
