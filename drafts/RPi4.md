###  RPi 4 Announced
#### DD-MM-YYYY

<intro>
The now annual annoucement of new Raspberry Pi models took place today with the Raspberry Pi 4 looking like a game changer. With options up to 4GB RAM, full 1GbE and 4k 60fps out this is the first model that is really capable of replacing your desktop PC. [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/06/the-raspberry-pi-4-launch-site-runs-on-a-pi-4-cluster/) have a decent break down of new models and benchmarks.

I think I'll invest in a few of these for a home cluster. My current thinking is I'll run [K3S](https://k3s.io), across them and migrate my services on older RPi models onto the cluster. At the moment I have one of the original RPi 1 Model Bs and a RPi 2 model B running a variety of services across the house:
</p>
<p>
* DHCP service 
* DNS service
* VPN end point
* Home baked network monitoring
* Various test containers

I'm also on the hunt for something cheap to run Minecraft on for my 8 year old step-daughter, again the 4GB RAM model should be more than powerful enough.
