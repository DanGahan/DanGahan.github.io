###  Welcome
#### DD-MM-YYYY

<intro>
Welcome to GAHAN dot ME dot UK and my first blog post. I'm Dan Gahan, a 30 something year old who lives in South Wales with my partner and our two children. This blog is intended as somewhere I can write about things that interest me. There will likely be a mix of technical blog posts, sport related posts and anything else that captures my attention.
</intro>

<p>
I've written this blog from scratch, rather than using some off the shelf blogging software, to try and keep bloat down and things running as fast as possible. While I work in the IT industry I'm no software engineer so there's been a steep learning curve to get this far and I'm sure I haven't always used the most elegant approach but things seem to be hanging together.

<p>
My intention is to post a couple of times a week with things I find interesting but we'll see how that goes once things get going.
