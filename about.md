Hi, I'm Dan. I live in South Wales with my partner, two young sons and our three dogs. I work as an IT consultant and generally enjoy anything technical. In my free time I enjoy watching sport, the odd pint and the occasional game on the Xbox. 
<br/><br/>

As previously predicted, I rarely actually blog. However, on the odd occasion that I do, you can expect a mix of:

* Tech commentary
* Rants about how Cardiff City will always let me down
* Posts about music
* Perhaps the occasional post about coffee.

### Contact me

I can be found in all the usual places
