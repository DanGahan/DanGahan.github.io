I’m finally getting ’round to finishing the Beastie Boys Book. Anyone familiar with the band would have expected the most poignant chapters to be centered around the passing of MCA, real name Adam Yauch, in 2012. My favourite being a chapter by Mike D titled Yanch Mixtape in which he list songs and albums MCA had become obsessed with over the years. It’s a great list, right up my street, better still user Mateusz Frankowski has created a Spotify playlist which I’m currently blaring into my headphones.<br><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/1175370181/playlist/5l6p3SkZoZF3blby0BZpH9" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
