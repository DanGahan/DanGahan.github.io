The now annual annoucement of new Raspberry Pi models took place today with the Raspberry Pi 4 looking like a game changer. With options up to 4GB RAM, full 1GbE and 4k 60fps out this is the first model that is really capable of replacing your desktop PC. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/06/the-raspberry-pi-4-launch-site-runs-on-a-pi-4-cluster/">Ars Technica</a> have a decent break down of new models and benchmarks.

Cardiff City Fixtures 2019-2020
</h3>
<h4>
22/06/2019

<p>
The <a href="https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/matches/fixtures/">fixtures for the 2019-2020 season</a> were released on Thursday so I thought I’d take the opportunity to have a run through month-by-month and attempt to predict how I think the City will get on. Overall I’d expect us to be there or thereabouts come the end of the season. It’s a tough league so I’d happily settle for a playoff place if offered it now.
