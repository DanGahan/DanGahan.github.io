I enjoyed this [article from the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210315-the-mystery-of-lost-rock-genius-lee-mavers) on the La's and their briliant debut self titled album.

The enigma that is Lee Mavers has fascinated me since I first properly listened to the La's in my student days. By all accounts it's unlikely he'll ever record anything else that he deems up to the standard to release so we'll just have to appreciate what was put out, even if it was against his wishes.
