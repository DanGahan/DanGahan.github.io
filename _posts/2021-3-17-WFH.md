This week marked exactly one year since working from home became the new normal. I went from travelling back and forth to London a couple of days a week to rarely travelling further than across my landing to my study. I decided to export my Outlook calendar into CSV format to just how I'd spent the past year. Highlights, if you can call them that, are:

* 219 Days working from home (all day event named WFH)
* That's 1,642.5 hours sat at my desk if we take the contracted 7.5 hours as the working day
* I've had 1105 Microsoft Teams meeting invites in that period and 45 Zoom calls
* In total the Teams meetings in my calendar ran for 904 hours and 35 minutes, or 37.7 days
* I had 274 meetings named Catch Up, that's a lot of catching up
* 5 days were spent at office locations, 4 Days in the Reading Office and 1 Day on client site in 102 Petty France
* 27 Days Annual Leave
* 8 Bank Holidays
